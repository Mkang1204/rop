This tutorial focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of unmapped reads using ROP. This tutorial is a step-by-step description of the ROP (Read Origin Protocol) to explore the unmapped reads left from your study.

We assume you have a basic knowledge of sequence analysis and of Unix-based operating systems (although you should be able to run the pipeline on MacOS, some commands may require modification). If you have limited knowledge of UNIX, we encourage you to follow the [Unix Tutorial](https://github.com/smangul1/rop/wiki/UNIX-Tutorial).
