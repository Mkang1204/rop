Processing 2515 unmapped reads of length 79.
1. Quality Control...
--identified 2194 low quality reads. Those reads are marked as lowQuality in the read name and are used in the donwstream analyis
--filtered 38 rRNA reads
2. Remapping to reference...
--identified 544 lost reads from unmapped reads. Among those: 8 reads with 0 mismatches, 3 reads with 1 mismatch, and 0 reads with 2 mismatches
***Read names of lost human reads are stored in /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropOut/lost.human.reads//lost_human_reads.txt
***Coordinates and other details of lost human reads are available from sam files: /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropOut/lost.human.reads/unmappedExample_genome.bam, /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropOut/lost.human.reads/unmappedExample_transcriptome.bam
3. Mapping repeat sequences...
--identified 4 lost repeat sequences from unmapped reads.
Read names of lost repeat reads are stored in /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropOut/lost.repeats//lost_repeat_reads.txt
***Note: Repeat sequences classification into classes (e.g. LINE) and families (e.g. Alu) will be available in next release
4. Non-co-linear RNA profiling is skipped.
5. T and B cell repetoires profiling

In total: 2 reads mapped to recombined TCRs rand BCRs,
** We summarized diversity of the immune repetoire and infiltration levels of T and B cells in /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropOut/immune.repertoire/immune.clonality.summary/summary.cdr3.txt
** Relative frequencies and counts of assembled CDR3s are available in /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropOut/immune.repertoire/immune.clonality.summary
