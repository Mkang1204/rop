Unmapped reads mapped to genome and/or transcriptome (using BWA, edit distance<6) are categorized as lost reads and are excluded from the further analysis. This includes : 0 reads with 0 mismatches, 0 reads with 1 mismatch, and0 reads with 2 mismatches.
Complete list of lost reads is available from sam files: /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropOut2/lostReads/unmappedExample_genome.sam, /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropOut2/lostReads/unmappedExample_transcriptome.sam
