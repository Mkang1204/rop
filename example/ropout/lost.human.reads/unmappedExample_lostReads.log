Unmapped reads mapped to genome and/or transcriptome (using BWA, edit distance<6) are categorized as lost reads and are excluded from the further analysis. This includes : 297 reads with 0 mismatches, 146 reads with 1 mismatch, and113 reads with 2 mismatches.
Complete list of lost reads is available from BAM files: /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropout/lost.human.reads/unmappedExample_genome.bam, /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropout/lost.human.reads/unmappedExample_transcriptome.bam
