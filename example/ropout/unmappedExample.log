Processing 2579 unmapped reads of length 100. Read length is calculated based on the first read of the sample. In case reads are of different length, this information is not accurate, but this will not affect the performance of ROP.
1. Quality Control...
--low quality filtering step is skipped
--filtered 42 reads from ribosomal DNA. Coordinates and other details of rDNA reads are available in /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropout/QC/unmappedExample_rDNA.bam
2. Remapping to reference...
--identified 1212 lost reads from unmapped reads. Among those: 297 reads with 0 mismatches, 146 reads with 1 mismatch, and 113 reads with 2 mismatches
***Read names of lost human reads are stored in /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropout/lost.human.reads//lost_human_reads.txt
***Coordinates and other details of lost human reads are available from sam files: /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropout/lost.human.reads/unmappedExample_genome.bam, /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropout/lost.human.reads/unmappedExample_transcriptome.bam
3. Mapping repeat sequences...
--identified 1 lost repeat sequences from unmapped reads.
Read names of lost repeat reads are stored in /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropout/lost.repeats//lost_repeat_reads.txt
***Note: Repeat sequences classification into classes (e.g. LINE) and families (e.g. Alu) will be available in next release
4. Non-co-linear RNA profiling is skipped.
5. T and B cell repetoires profiling

In total: 2 reads mapped to recombined TCRs rand BCRs,
** We summarized diversity of the immune repetoire and infiltration levels of T and B cells in /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropout/immune.repertoire/immune.clonality.summary/summary.cdr3.txt
** Relative frequencies and counts of assembled CDR3s are available in /u/home/galaxy/collaboratory/serghei/code/rop/example/ropout/immune.repertoire/immune.clonality.summary
