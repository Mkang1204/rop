Processing 2503 unmapped reads of length 79.
1. Quality Control...
--filtered 2218 low quality reads
--filtered 2 low complexity reads (e.g. ACACACAC...)
--filtered 20 rRNA reads
In total: 2240 reads failed QC and are filtered out.
2. Remapping to reference...
--identified 1 lost reads from unmapped reads. Among those: 1 reads with 0 mismatches, 0 reads with 1 mismatch, and 0 reads with 2 mismatches
***Note: Complete list of lost reads is available from sam files: /u/home/s/serghei/code2/rop/test/lostReads/unmapped_genome.sam, /u/home/s/serghei/code2/rop/test/lostReads/unmapped_transcriptome.sam
3. Mapping to repeat sequences is skipped.
4. Non-co-linear RNA profiling is skipped.
5. Lymphocyte profiling

Compiling read names.
In total: 12 (unique) reads mapped to antibody repertoire loci.
6.  Microbiome profiling is skipped.
Summary: The ROP protocol is able to account for 2253 reads
***Unaccounted reads (not explained by ROP) are saved to /u/home/s/serghei/code2/rop/test/unmapped_unaccountedReads.fasta
***Log file with all the commands used is available here: /u/home/s/serghei/code2/rop/test/dev.log
Important: ROP relies on several open source tools that were developed by other groups. These components are (c) their respective developers and are redistributed with ROP to provide ease-of-use. The list of the tools used by ROP and the parameters/reference databases are provided here: /u/home/s/serghei/code2/rop/test/tools.log
